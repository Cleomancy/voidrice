# voidrice
a port of my DWM config for void linux

I use DWM and friends to make my pc look pretty, This is my preconfigured build

Everything has been configured to compile under Void Linux You'll probably have to install some dependencies yourself ALSO you may want to change the keyboard layout in the .xinitrc

PREREQ. xorg-server, xorg (I use xorg-minimal with xrdb setxkbmap and xauth) xinit base-devel libX11-devel libXft-devel libXinerama-devel feh unclutter unzip font-awesome and a ttf of your choice I personally use font-hack-ttf but you can change that in the script (xbacklight for laptops)

Feel free to use it.
